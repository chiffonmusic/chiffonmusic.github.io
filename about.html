    <p>Hey! What are you doing here?</p>
    <p>Anyway, welcome to my website. Trying to make it look nice. Actually, a lot of years ago I gained an interest in studying HTML of all things but I kind of grew bored. It's pretty easy though. And I still remember how to do many of things that I learned some time ago.</p>
